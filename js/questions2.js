		'hint' : 'This is a variation on the "What\'s your greatest weakness?" question as the idea here is to identify what aspect within the company will be the hardest part to handle. Another way to word this is, "What part of this job will be the most difficult for you?" Whatever you pick as the item isn\'t the key point as much as it is what kind of follow-up do you give to it. For example, if writing documentation was a great challenge then one may answer that, "Going back to document what was done and why it was done is often a challenge as there are usually other top priority tasks to get done yet I do try to set aside some of my time to ensure that things are written down in a wiki or something that is accessible to everyone on the team," so that while the documentation is the challenge, there are things being done about it. Some people may pick that they are very diligent about doing good work and may have issues with perfectionistic tendencies.'
